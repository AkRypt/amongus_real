# Among Us Real

This is a website which enables you to play the popular game Among Us in real life with a group of friends and in-real tasks which you can set to your liking.
You and your friends can join a lobby and decide on tasks. You can then start the game and 30% of the players will be randomly selected as imposters.

The crewmates have to finish the tasks while the imposter is trying to kill the crewmates. There will be a cooldown for the imposter between killing crewmates and the crewmates have to complete all their tasks to win. If all the crewmates are dead first, the imposters win.

You can set the rules for killing (such as touch to kill, etc.,.) in real and use the website to keep track of the progress.

There will be emergency meetings and voting system included which will help you properly go with the flow of the game.

This idea was inspired by a fun event organised at NJIT.

Have fun playing! =)
